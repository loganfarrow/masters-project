# masters-project

This repository includes all of the materials from Logan Farrow's SP2025 3 Credit Masters Project. My advisors were Roger Chamberalin, Chandler Ahrens, and Christopher Gill. This project was an exploration of using Apple's SwiftUI framework to build a "remote control" application to send commands to the 618 mirror array located in Steinberg Hall. The project began with learning SwiftUI through building 3 sample apps. The next phase was building a working web version of the controller in React to serve as a wireframe. Finally, the project culminated in desiging a SwiftUI app from the ground up to faciliate finetuned group and single mirror control, image uploading, custom seat lighting vua automatic mirror adjustment. A more comprehensive overview can be found within the Project Presentation PDF and the Project Report PDF.
